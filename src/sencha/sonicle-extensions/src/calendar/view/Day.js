	/**
	 * @cfg {Integer} hourHeight

	 * 
	 * **Important note:** 
	 * While this config can be set to any reasonable integer value, note that it is also used to calculate the ratio used 
	 * when assigning event heights. By default, an hour is 60 minutes and 42 pixels high, so the pixel-to-minute ratio is 
	 * 42 / 60, or 0.7. This same ratio is then used when rendering events. When rendering a 30 minute event, the rendered 
	 * height would be 30 minutes * 0.7 = 21 pixels (as expected).
	 * 
	 * This is important to understand when changing this value because some browsers may handle pixel rounding in different 
	 * ways which could lead to inconsistent visual results in some cases. If you have any problems with pixel precision in 
	 * how events are laid out, you might try to stick with hourHeight values that will generate discreet ratios. This is 
	 * easily done by simply multiplying 60 minutes by different discreet ratios (.6, .8, 1.1, etc.) to get the corresponding 
	 * hourHeight pixel values (36, 48, 66, etc.) that will map back to those ratios. By contrast, if you chose an hourHeight 
	 * of 50 for example, the resulting height ratio would be 50 / 60 = .833333... This will work just fine, just be aware 
	 * that browsers may sometimes round the resulting height values inconsistently.

	 * @cfg {Number} minBodyHeight
	 * The minimum height for the scrollable body view (defaults to 150 pixels). By default the body is auto
	 * height and simply fills the available area left by the overall layout. However, if the browser window
	 * is too short and/or the header area contains a lot of events on a given day, the body area could
	 * become too small to be usable. Because of that, if the body falls below this minimum height, the
